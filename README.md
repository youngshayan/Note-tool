# Note-tool
Hi, this is my first big project which I program in c language, it takes a month to be fully programmed and debugged.

In this app, you can set a reminder easily by setting the date and time and then adding your note to the reminder.

you can check your previous set reminders in sort of day, month and year, you can also delete your reminders in that sort too.

I use some of the cmd commands like color, pause, CDL, etc to improve the performance of the app.

I'm sorry the app UI is so simple and basic I will try to improve that in the future.

Hope you like the app I program.
